Great! Github Observer for Manybots has been installed.

Now what?

1. Run `bundle exec rake db:migrate` to get your db up to speed
2. Edit `config/initializers/manybots-github.rb` to use your app id and 
secret (more info in the `README` file)
3. Go to `/manybots-github` and start collecting your commits (you might have to relaunch the server)

You can find help on the Manybots Dev mailing list.
